A source is where data comes from. Endpoints and loads refer to sources by name.

| Type | What it reads | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `sql` | any database SQLAlchemy supports (Oracle, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite) | read-only by default; **Allow writes** for create/update/delete endpoints and as a load target |
| `file` | CSV, JSON, JSON Lines, Excel in the project's `data` folder | always read-only; re-read automatically when the file changes |
| `rest` | an upstream HTTP API | the host must be allow-listed; credentials are added by restforge, callers' keys are never forwarded |
| `callable` | functions in a Python module in `handlers\` | only functions you name are callable |

## In Studio

1. **Sources > Add source**, choose the type.
2. **SQL**: pick the database credential. Switch on **Allow writes** only if endpoints must change data
   or a load writes into this database.
3. **File**: type the file name inside the data folder (for example `transfers.csv`). In the desktop window
   **Browse…** copies a file from anywhere into the data folder. For Excel, give the sheet name.
4. **REST**: base URL (e.g. `https://hr-api.corp.local/v2`), tick *Allow restforge to call this host*,
   choose a credential, add extra headers as `Name=value` lines.
5. **Callable**: the module, e.g. `handlers.pricing` for `handlers\pricing.py`.
6. **Test** (play button) connects to the database, or shows the first rows of a file.

To refresh a file source, copy the new file over the old one in `data\` – nothing else is needed.

## With the CLI

```powershell
restforge source add hr -t sql --credential hr_oracle                 # read-only
restforge source add hr_rw -t sql --credential hr_oracle --read-write  # for writes and loads
restforge source add transfers -t file --path transfers.csv
restforge source add budget -t file --path budget.xlsx --sheet FY27
restforge source add crm -t rest --base-url https://crm.corp.local/api --allow-host --credential crm_token
restforge source add pricing -t callable --module handlers.pricing --allow-credential erp

restforge source list
restforge source test transfers          # shows the first rows
restforge source test hr                 # connects to the database
restforge source set-credential hr new_login
restforge source remove old_source       # refused while endpoints or loads use it
```

Refresh a file from another folder (e.g. in a scheduled job):

```powershell
Copy-Item \\fileserver\exports\transfers.csv C:\apps\hr-api\data\transfers.csv -Force
```
